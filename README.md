## Project Overview

The **Airport Management System** is a web application designed to manage various operations at an airport. It facilitates the management of employees, flight schedules, passenger bookings, gate/runway assignments, and more.

This system ensures efficient and seamless airport operations by leveraging a robust database and an intuitive interface.

---

## Features

- **Employee Management:**
  - Add employees with either gate or runway assignments.
  - Update gate/runway assignments dynamically.

- **Flight Management:**
  - View available flights based on the date and destination.
  - Book tickets for passengers.

- **Validation:**
  - Ensures data integrity (e.g., employees cannot be assigned both a gate and a runway).

- **Dynamic Updates:**
  - Seamlessly update employee assignments and flight information via stored procedures.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask)
  - MySQL (Database)

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS (with responsive design)
  - Jinja2 Templating

- **Stored Procedures:**
  - MySQL procedures for efficient database operations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airport-management-system.git
   cd airport-management-system
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Create a MySQL database named `airport_management`.
   - Execute the provided SQL scripts to set up tables and procedures:
     ```sql
     source Airport_tables.sql; 
     source procedures.sql;
     ```
     <!-- (Note:- Airport_tables do not contain values) -->

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   - Install the required packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install flask mysql-connector-python
     ```

4. **Configure the Application:**
   - Update the `config.py` file with your database credentials:
     ```python
     DB_HOST = "localhost"
     DB_USER = "root"
     DB_PASSWORD = "your_password"
     DB_NAME = "airport_management"
     ```

5. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Database Schema

### Tables
1. **Employee Table:**
   - Tracks employees and their gate or runway assignments.

2. **Flight Table:**
   - Maintains flight schedules and details.

3. **Tickets Table:**
   - Records passenger bookings.

4. **Gate and Runway Tables:**
   - Stores gate and runway information.

### Procedures
- `UpdateEmployeeGateRunway`: Updates employee assignments for gate/runway.
- `BookTicket`: Handles ticket bookings.

---

## Usage

### Employee Management
- Add employees by specifying their gate or runway assignments.
- Update employee assignments dynamically through a simple form.

### Flight Booking
- View available flights for a specific destination and date.
- Book tickets for passengers while ensuring seat availability.

### Validation
- The system prevents data conflicts (e.g., assigning both a gate and a runway).
